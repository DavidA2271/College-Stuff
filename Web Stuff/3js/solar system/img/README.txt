Vite makes it very easier and fast to work with libraries.

  npm create vite@latest

follow the instructions like giving name of project and package name etc.

cd project_name

  npm install

Now you will see a localhost running vite app

  npm run dev 

delete the unnecessary files

  npm install three

Starting making the scene and that's it. Hope it works
