# Analysis
The overall time-complexity is a bit confusing to me. I iterate through every job, so it is at least linear. There is a nested loop that iterates over the current most profitible jobs and breaks out when a job is replaced. The most profitable jobs are dependednt on the input jobs, but only contain a fraction of them, so it is not completely linear. So I would like to say the time-complexity is O(n*logn).  

My approach to this problem changed a few times as I worked on it. I had a few idea like taking the 5 most profitable independent of deadline, then swapping in less profitable ones that fit the deadline. I also thought of organizing the input jobs by deadline and selecting the most profitable of each deadline (Ex: Select most profitable job with deadline = 1, select most profitable with deadline = 2, and so on). Both seemed a bit too difficult to implement while working around the deadline constraint. So I had an idea to only add elements that fit the deadline constrint to the list and swap them out for more profitable ones that also fit the deadline.
